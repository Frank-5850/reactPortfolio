During my highschool years I started working at IKEA as a sales associate and during my 12 years here I eventually got promoted to a Sales Planning specialist where i manage sales for 3 departments. In 2020 I decided to change career paths to learn web development as my fascination from it in highschool revitalized with a goal of becoming a full stack Developer. I am currently in a bootcamp program studying coding at UC Berkeley extension. I have developed knowledge to be able to create applications using the MERN stack. I also learned how to use CSS frameworks such as Bootstrap, Bulma, and Materailize. I learned how to use database programs such as MySql and MongoDB along with their node libraries; sequelize and mongoose respectively. I also learned many different node libraries; express, axios, passport, dotenv, and nodemailer just to name a few. My ambition is to use the tools I obtained through this course and create technology for those that have technological disadvantages and bridge the gap."})]}),Object(d.jsx)("h3",{className:"mb-3 border-bottom border-dark",children:"Projects"}),Object(d.jsxs)("div",{className:"row position-relative ",children:[Object(d.jsxs)("div",{className:"card col-md-3 mx-auto mb-3",children:[Object(d.jsx)("img",{src:p,className:"card-img-top",alt:""}),Object(d.jsxs)("div",{className:"card-body",children:[Object(d.jsx)("h5",{className:"card-title",children:"Fitness Tracker"}),Object(d.jsx)("p",{className:"card-text",children:"This application was created to allow users to track workout routines.
